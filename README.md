The system dynamically displays different images and background colors depending on the time of day.
This is achieved using JavaScript to retrieve the current hour and then updating the displayed content accordingly.

Here's how it works:

The system retrieves the current hour using the Date object in JavaScript.
Based on the hour obtained, it determines whether it's morning, afternoon, evening, or night.
Depending on the time of day:

Morning: The system displays an image representing the morning, such as sunrise or clear sky, and sets a background color associated with morning, like shades of blue or yellow.

Afternoon: An image depicting daytime activities or sunny weather is shown, along with a background color reminiscent of daylight, perhaps shades of orange or light blue.

Evening: Images showing sunset scenes or nighttime activities are displayed, along with darker background colors like deep blue or purple.

Night: The system shows images associated with nighttime, such as stars or moonlit landscapes, and uses dark background colors to represent the night sky.

By dynamically changing the images and background colors, the system provides users with a visually engaging and contextually relevant experience that reflects the time of day in their environment. This enhances user interaction and immersion while using the system.
